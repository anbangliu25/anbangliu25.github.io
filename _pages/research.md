My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and classical mathematical optimization, with a specific focus on developing Machine Learning approaches and Mixed Integer Programming approaches to solve challenging decision-making problems arising in manufacturing systems, supply chains, and power systems.

If you have any ideas you'd like to discuss or collaborate on, please feel free to contact me via (anbang at hku dot hk).
