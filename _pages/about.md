I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Data and Systems Engineering at the University of Hong Kong, working with [Prof. Max Z.J. Shen](https://www.dase.hku.hk/people/max-z-j-shen). Prior to joining HKU, I received my Ph.D. degree from Center for Intelligent and Networked Systems at Tsinghua University in 2024, where I fortunately conducted research under the guidance of [Prof. Peter Luh](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/peter-b-luh/), [Prof. Xiaohong Guan](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1018/3083.htm), and [Prof. Xi Chen](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1076/3193.htm). Additionally, from 2023 to 2024, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, college park, advised by [Prof. Zhi-Long Chen](https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/zhi-long-chen). 


Research Interests
======
My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and classical mathematical optimization, with a specific focus on developing Mixed Integer Programming approaches and Machine Learning approaches to solve challenging decision-making problems arising in manufacturing systems, supply chains, and power systems.

If you have any ideas you'd like to discuss or collaborate on, please feel free to contact me via (anbang at hku dot hk).
