I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Data and Systems Engineering at the University of Hong Kong, working with [Prof. Max Z.J. Shen](https://www.dase.hku.hk/people/max-z-j-shen). Prior to joining HKU, I received my Ph.D. degree from Center for Intelligent and Networked Systems at Tsinghua University, where I fortunately conducted research under the guidance of Prof. Peter Luh, Prof. Xiaohong Guan, and Prof. Xi Chen. From 2023 to 2024, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, college park, advised by [Prof. Zhi-Long Chen](https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/zhi-long-chen). 


Research Interests
======
My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and classical mathematical optimization, with a specific focus on leveraging machine learning and combinatorial optimization techniques to address challenging decision-making problems arising in manufacturing systems, supply chains, and power systems.

If you have any ideas you'd like to discuss or collaborate on, please feel free to contact me via (anbang at hku dot hk).
