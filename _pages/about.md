I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Data and Systems Engineering at the University of Hong Kong, working with Prof. Max Zuojun Shen. Prior to joining HKU, I received my Ph.D. degree from Center for Intelligent and Networked Systems at Tsinghua University, where I fortunately conducted research under the guidance of Prof. Peter Luh, Prof. Xiaohong Guan, and Prof. Xi Chen. From 2023 to 2024, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, college park, advised by Prof. Zhilong Chen. 

My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and classical mathematical optimization, with a specific focus on leveraging machine learning and combinatorial optimization techniques to address challenging decision-making problems arising in manufacturing systems, supply chains, and power systems.
